# BME 590 Design
## LED Device Prototyping Project
###### Where Things Are
- Arduino code is in the 'Software' folder
- Schematic and PCB designs are in the 'Hardware' folder
###### Design Features and Flaws
- met all the constraints: runs on single battery up to 9 V, electronics connected to a single PCB, weighs less than 1 lb, all dimensions are less than 6 in, definitely costs less than $50, battery is easily replaceable
- is waterproof
- tightly encloses the board and the battery with minimum extra space inside the case, minimizing the device size
- securely holds the board and the battery in place; does not move around or fall apart even when shaken violently upside down
- easy to change battery
- the case is light-colored (almost semi-transparent) that you can see the changing LED responses with the lid closed
- the lid snugly fits in most of the times but not all the time; could be fixed by having a slightly more spacious lid
